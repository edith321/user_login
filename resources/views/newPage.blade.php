        <div>Just as the saying “a chip off the old block” often holds true for humans, it can apply to dogs as well. Puppies
            that are well-socialized are more likely to come from dogs that are well-socialized.

            A basic part of a pup’s socialization is based on their mother’s attitude–relaxed or skittish–toward people. The way
            you interact with your new puppy can play a big role, too. Playing, petting, and talking with your pup can help him
            or her develop the “people skills” needed to be a good member of the family and the neighborhood.

            While weaning for puppies can take place at six to seven weeks, they are still learning important skills from their
            littermates as their mother gradually leaves them for longer periods of time. Puppies that stay with their litter
            for at least three months are more likely to develop good social skills as they act as role models for each other.

            When puppies are separated from their littermates too early, they often fail to develop key social skills, such as
            sending and receiving signals, the hierarchy process (who is in charge), how far to go in play-wrestling, what
            mouthing pressure is acceptable (inhibited bite), and so forth. Play is important for puppies. It increases their
            dexterity, social interaction, and helps them to learn their boundaries.

            Through these interactions with their mother and littermates, puppies learn what being a dog is all about. During
            the first eight weeks of age, skills not acquired may be lost forever.

            Most dogs are considered puppies for up to two years of age, though puppyish behavior may end sooner or last longer
            in some breeds. The stages listed below are essential and fairly constant. However, dogs are open to new knowledge
            and training well beyond the puppy years. Here are some general guidelines for puppies’ stages of development.
